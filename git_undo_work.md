## Use cases

| Command        | Scope              | Common use cases |    
|----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| `git checkout <file>`  |            | Undo changes to a file  |
| `git reset HEAD <file>`  |          | Undo a `git add <file>` |
| `git revert HEAD~` |                | Revert last commit |
|                |                    |                |
| `git checkout` | Commit-level	      | Switch between branches or inspect old snapshots |
| `git checkout` | File-level	        | Discard changes in the working directory |
|                |                    |                | 
| `git revert`	  | Commit-level	      | Undo commits in a public branch |
| `git revert`	  | File-level	        | (N/A) |
|                |                    |                |
| `git reset`  *  | Commit-level       | Discard commits in a private branch or throw away uncommited changes  |  
* use `git revert` over `git reset`; it is better practice  
* `git revert HEAD~1` goes back two commits

## Discard uncommitted changes to a file
Situation:  you've changed a file, but not yet committed the changes

git checkout README.md
```

## How to undo an add (undo a staged file)
```
git reset HEAD <file>       
```


## Revert Commit (* recommended way)
**Reverting undoes a commit by creating a new commit. This is a safe way to undo changes, as it has no chance of re-writing the commit history.** For example, the following command will figure out the changes contained in the 2nd to last commit, create a new commit undoing those changes, and tack the new commit onto the existing project.  
```bash
git checkout branch_name
git log -4
git revert HEAD~2
```

## How to Undo a Commit
On the commit-level, resetting is a way to move the tip of a branch to a different commit. This can be used to remove commits from the current branch. For example, the following command moves the hotfix branch backwards by two commits.

```console
git reset --soft HEAD^     # use --soft if you want to keep your changes
git reset --hard HEAD^     # use --hard if you don't care about keeping the changes you made
```

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1    # use --soft to preserve changes that were made and undo last commit (~1 = back 1 commit)
```

#### Syntax for Windows Users
Note:  use `~` instead of `^`
